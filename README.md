## Overview
This project is for controlling our air brakes system with the goal of making our rocket "hit" its target apogee. We have a Raspberry Pi 5 as the brains of our system which runs our code. It connects to a servo motor to control the extension of our air brakes and an [IMU](https://www.microstrain.com/inertial-sensors/3dm-cx5-15) (basically an altimeter, accelerometer, and gyroscope). The code follows the [finite state machine](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/state_pattern.htm) design pattern, using the [`AirbrakesContext`](https://github.com/NCSU-High-Powered-Rocketry-Club/AirbrakesV2/blob/main/airbrakes/airbrakes.py) to manage interactions between the states, hardware, logging, and data processing.

### Design
As per the finite state machine design pattern, we have a context class which links everything together. Every loop, the context:

1. **Gets data from the IMU**
2. **Processes the data** in the Data Processor (calculates velocity, averages, maximums, etc.)
3. **Updates the current state** with the processed data
4. **Predicts the apogee** If the program is in Coast State
5. **Controls the servo extension** based on the current state's instructions (e.g., extends air brakes to slow down the rocket)
6. **Logs all data** from the IMU, Data Processor, Servo, Apogee Predictor and States

### Launch Data

This is our interest launch flight data, altitude over time. The different colors of the line are different states the rocket goes through:
1. Standby - when the rocket is on the rail on the ground.
2. Motor Burn - when the motor is burning and the rocket is accelerating.
3. Coast - after the motor has burned out and the rocket is coasting, this is when air brakes
deployment will be controlled by the bang-bang controller.
4. Free Fall - when the rocket is falling back to the ground after apogee, this is when the air
brakes will be retracted.
5. Landed - when the rocket lands on the ground. After a few seconds in landed state, the
Airbrakes program will end.

### File Structure

We have put great effort into keeping the file structure of this project organized and concise. Try to be intentional on where you place new files or directories.

## Quick Start

This project only supports Linux. We also strongly recommend using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage and install
the project. To quickly run the mock replay, simply run:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/NCSU-High-Powered-Rocketry-Club/AirbrakesV2.git mock
```

You should see the mock replay running with a display!

_Note: We will continue using `uv` for the rest of this README, if you don't want to use `uv`, you can set up the project using Python. See [Legacy Project Setup](legacy_project_setup.md) for more information._

## Local Setup

If you want to contribute to the project, you will need to set up the project locally. Luckily, 
the only other thing you need to install is [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

### 1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/NCSU-High-Powered-Rocketry-Club/AirbrakesV2.git
cd AirbrakesV2
```

### 2. Install the project:
```bash
uv run mock
```

This will install the project, including development dependencies, activate the virtual environment and run the mock replay.

_Note: It is important to use `uv run` instead of `uvx` since the `uvx` environment is isolated from
the project. See the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/#relationship-to-uv-run) for more information._

_Note 2: The more "correct" command to run is `uv sync`. This will install the project and its dependencies, but not run the mock replay._

### 3. Install the pre-commit hook:
```
uv run pre-commit install
```
This will install a pre-commit hook that will run the linter before you commit your changes.

You will see the linter run now. If one of the checks failed, you can resolve them by following the 
instructions in [Running the Linter](#running-the-linter).

```bash
git push -u origin branch-name
```

## Advanced Local Usage

### Running Mock Launches
Testing our code can be difficult, so we've developed a way to run mock launches based on previous flight data--the rocket pretends, in real-time, that it's flying through a previous launch.

To run a mock launch, run:
```bash
uv run mock
```
If you want to run a mock launch, but with the real servo running, run:
```bash
uv run mock -r
```
To run a mock launch with our custom simulation:
```bash
uv run sim
```
There are some additional options you can use when running a mock launch. To view them all, run:
```bash
uv run mock --help
```

### Running Tests
Our CI pipeline uses [pytest](https://pytest.org) to run tests. You can run the tests locally to ensure that your changes are working as expected.

_Note: Unit tests do not work on Windows (only `test_integration.py` will work)._

To run the tests, run this command from the project root directory:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

If your virtual environment is activated, you can simply run the tests with `pytest`

To generate a coverage report from the tests:
```bash
pytest --cov=airbrakes --cov-report=term
```

To performance test the code:
```bash
pytest --benchmark-only --benchmark-save=name
```

See the [pytest-benchmark documentation](https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more information.

To run a performance benchmark with the real IMU on the raspberry pi:
```bash
sudo $(which uv) run pytest -m imu_benchmark
```

Note that the use of `sudo` is required to set process priorities for the IMU and main process,
which is critical for accurate benchmarking.

If you make a change to the code, please make sure to update or add the necessary tests.

### Running the Linter

Our CI also tries to maintain code quality by running a linter. We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).

To run the linter, and fix any issues it finds, run:
```bash
ruff check . --fix --unsafe-fixes
```
To format the code, run:
```bash
ruff format .
```
You can also run the linter with `uv`:
```bash
uv run ruff format .
```

## Pi Usage

_There are libraries that only fully work when running on the Pi (gpiozero, mscl, picamera2), so if you're having trouble importing them locally, program the best you can and test your changes on the pi._


### Connecting to the Pi (SSH)
In order to connect to the Pi, you need first to set up a mobile hotspot with the name `HPRC`, password `tacholycos`, and `2.4 GHz` band. Next, turn on the Pi and it will automatically connect to your hotspot. Once it's connected, find the Pi's IP Address, and in your terminal run:
```bash
ssh pi@[IP.ADDRESS]
# Its password is "raspberry"
cd AirbrakesV2/
```

### Install the dependencies needed for the camera and servo integration:

```bash
sudo apt install libcap-dev libcamera-dev libkms++-dev libfmt-dev libdrm-dev liblgpio-dev

uv sync --all-groups
```


### Run a real flight with real hardware:
```bash
sudo $(which uv) run real -v
```

### Running Test Scripts
During development, you may want to run individual scripts to test components. For example, to test the servo, run:
```bash
# Make sure you are in the root directory:
uv run scripts/run_servo.py
```
