This folder contains various test data taken by the IMU. Currently used in data processor tests to ensure acceleration rotations are calculated correctly.

## Data

All datasets are named according to what the vertical orientation of the IMU was when the test was taken.
For example: `xminus.csv` began and finished with the negative x axis pointing upwards.

All datasets began at rest, moved upwards in their respective vertical direction, and then moved downwards back to their original starting location.
